          <a class="#clor"><strong>The Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology(KNUST)</strong> </a>is the public university established in the country, as well as the largest university in the Kumasi Metropolis and in the Ashanti Region.

KNUST has its roots in the plans of the King Asantehene Agyeman Prempeh I to establish a university in Kumasi as part of his drive towards modernization of his Ashanti kingdom.

This plan never came to fruition due to the clash between British empire expansion and the desire for King Prempeh I to preserve his Ashanti kingdom’s independence.

However, his younger brother and successor, King Asantehene Agyeman Prempeh II, upon ascending to the Golden Stool in <a class="#clor">1935</a>, continued with this vision.Events in the Gold Coast in the <a class="#clor">1940s</a> played into his hands.

First there was the establishment of the University College of the Gold Coast.

Secondly, there were the 1948 Accra riots and the consequent Watson Commission report which recommended that a university of sciences be established in Kumasi.

Thus, in <a class="#clor">1949</a>, the dream of the Prempehs became a reality when building started on what was to be called the Kumasi College of Technology.

The Kumasi College of Technology offered admission to its first students to the engineering faculty in 1951 (they entered in 1952), and an Act of Parliament gave the university its legal basis as the Kumasi College of Technology in 1952.

The nucleus of the college was formed from 200 teacher training students transferred from Achimota College in the Greater Accra Region. The college was affiliated to the University of London.

In 1961, the college was granted full university status.

The university covers a total land area of 2512.96 acres.

The main campus which is about seven square miles in area, is about eight miles (13 km) to the east of Kumasi, the Ashanti Regional capital.

In November 2019, KNUST was ranked as the best university in Ghana and West Africa by U.S. News & World Report.

It was also ranked 14th in Africa and 706th in the world, with a global score of 42.4.

In November 2020 it was ranked the best for the second time by U.S. News & World Report. This time it climbed 2 positions to be 12th best in Africa.

Principal Officers

The principal officers of the university are the chancellor, chairman of the University Council and vice-chancellor.

As of 2018, the position of chancellor was held by the Asantehene Otumfuo Osei Tutu II.

		  Students through the KNUST Students’ Representative Council (KNUST SRC) participate in the administration of the university through their representatives serving on the University Council, 
		  Academic Board, the Welfare Services Board, Faculty and Departmental Boards, Residence Committee, Library Committee and on the Hall Councils.

		  <strong><a href="#clor">Collegiate system</a></strong>
College of Engineering, KNUST auditorium KNUST has, since January 2005, transformed from its previous centralized system of administration into a decentralized collegiate university.
Under this system, the faculties have been condensed into six colleges.
The university had been administered on the faculty-based system. This led to administrative difficulties as new faculties and institutes were created to meet the ever-growing academic pursuits of students.

To solve this problem, a collegiate system was officially adopted on 29 November 2004. On 5 April 2005, the pioneering provosts were inducted and invested into office at the Great Hall of the KNUST.

The colleges are semi-autonomous, which means that they are given the power to largely run on their own without much dependence on the central administration for financial support.

A college registrar, finance officer and librarian assist the provosts. Under them are the faculties, centres and institutes, headed by deans and directors.

As heads of the colleges, the provosts provide academic and administrative leadership for the colleges and oversee their overall running.
